# Child_AdultBMI
Simulations for methods of estimating effects of child and adult effects in MR

Each Simulation scenario produces a set of results for the associated paper;

Simulations a/b -> Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1
Simulation c -> Table 2
Simulations d/e -> Table 3

MRest is the function applied as part of these simulations to obtain MR estimates.
